## Getting Started

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fapputa/Vanilla_CLI.git
cd Vanilla_CLI
```

**2. Run the installer as root:**

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

The installer will automatically:
- Detect your package manager (`apt` or `pacman`) and install system dependencies
- Install Python dependencies (`rich`, `prompt_toolkit`, `pygments`, `psutil`)
- Build `abyss`, `lsc`, and `lsc-config` with `make clean && make`
- Deploy all commands to both `~/bin` and `/usr/local/bin`
- Remove compiled binaries and object files from the project root once installed

## Abyss - Text Editor

Engineered for zero-latency, Abyss is written in C and uses a **Gap Buffer** and **Line Indexing** to handle massive files without breaking a sweat.

- **Performance:** O(1) insertions and deletions
- **Architecture:** Low-level memory management with `ncurses` for a flicker-free UI
- **Features:** Undo/Redo, syntax highlighting, integrated compilation, hex view

### Manual Build

```bash
make clean && make
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
sudo cp abyss /usr/local/bin/
# also copy to user-local bin
cp abyss ~/bin/
```

### Usage

```bash
abyss main.c
```

### Keybindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl + S` | Save file |
| `Ctrl + Q` | Exit |
| `Ctrl + Z` | Undo |
| `Ctrl + Y` | Redo |
| `Ctrl + B` | Compile and run (via `compil`) |
| `Ctrl + N` | Split screen view |
| `Ctrl + K` | Delete current line |
| `F2` | Hex view |

## lsc - Colorized ls

A drop-in replacement for `ls` with fully customizable per-extension colorization, driven by a simple config file (`~/.colorrc`) and a ncurses TUI editor.

### Features

- Per-extension color rules (`.c`, `.py`, `.md`, ...)
- Special rules for directories (`dir`), executables (`exec`), symlinks (`link`), and files without extension (`noext`)
- Attributes: `bold`, `italic`, `underline`, `outline` (reverse video)
- 16 named colors + full 256-color palette
- Automatic column layout matching your terminal width, with proper UTF-8 display width handling
- Compatible with `ls` flags (`-l`, `-a`, `-h`, ...)

### Manual Build

```bash
gcc -O2 -Wall -Wextra -o lsc lsc.c
gcc -O2 -Wall -Wextra -o lsc-config lsc-config.c -lncurses
```

Or from the root with make:

```bash
make lsc
make lsc-config
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
# User-local
cp lsc        ~/bin/lsc
cp lsc-config ~/bin/lsc-config

# System-wide
sudo cp lsc        /usr/local/bin/lsc
sudo cp lsc-config /usr/local/bin/lsc-config
```

### Usage

```bash
lsc              # current directory
lsc -la          # long format, all files
lsc ~/projects   # specific directory
lsc-config       # open the TUI color rule editor
```

To replace `ls` permanently, add to your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
alias ls='lsc'
alias lsconfig='lsc-config'
```

### Config file - `~/.colorrc`

```
# format: .ext = FG [BG] [bold] [italic] [underline] [outline]
# special keys: dir  exec  link  noext

#         0-255                           (256-color palette)

dir            = blue bold
exec           = red outline
link           = cyan italic

| `wipe` | Clears the content of a file while preserving its original permissions. |
| `tree` | Displays a visual tree of the current directory structure. |

- Active network interfaces, mounted network drives, packet counters
- Python version and installed package count

### `wifi_monitoring`
